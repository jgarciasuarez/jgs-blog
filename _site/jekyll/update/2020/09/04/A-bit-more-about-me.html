    <p>Hi everyone, I started this blog as a means to convey my research in an informal (yet still technical) way. </p>

<p>My aim is to create posts for each of my papers, and give a more informal, yet collegial, assessment of my intentions when writing them and what I think are te main contributions there. I’ll try to embellish the post using extra figures and animations. I tried hosting this blog on ResearchGate, but the site does not lend itself to it.</p>

<p>Allow me a brief bio sketch:</p>

<p>I got my “ingeniero industrial” diploma from University of Sevilla, in 2013. Right after that, I joined Next Force Engineering, a structural engineering consulting company, based in my hometown as welll.</p>

<p>About two years and a half later, I joined Caltech to pursue a Master in Space Engineering. Later on, I had a chance to join <a href="https://www.asimaki.caltech.edu/">Prof. Asimaki’s group</a> and earn my PhD. <a href="http://www.ortiz.caltech.edu/">Prof. Michael Ortíz</a> (who served as my academic advisor during the master, as thesis committee member and effectively as a co-advisor) has also been an strong influence during my formative years at Caltech.</p>

<p>The main theme of my thesis was applications of the path-independent integrals of Continuum Mechanics to Geotechnical Engineering. Along the way, I got acquainted with 1D Site Response Analysis, and I have throughly enjoyed working on the subject ever since. 
I had a chance to stay at Caltech for an extra year to wrap up someside work in Seismic Metamaterials, while working in a project with the USGS to study the seismic response of rock pinnacles. </p>
