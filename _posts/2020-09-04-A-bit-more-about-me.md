Hi everyone, I started this blog as a means to convey my research in an informal (yet still technical) way. 

My aim is to create posts for each of my papers, and give a more informal, yet collegial, assessment of my intentions when writing them and what I think are the main contributions there. I’ll try to embellish the post using extra figures and animations. I tried hosting this blog on ResearchGate, but the site does not lend itself to it.

Allow me a brief bio sketch: 

I got my “ingeniero industrial” diploma from University of Sevilla, in 2013. Right after that, I joined Next Force Engineering, a structural engineering consulting company, based in my hometown as well. 

About two years and a half later, I joined Caltech to pursue a Master in Space Engineering. Later on, I had a chance to join [Prof. Asimaki’s group](https://www.asimaki.caltech.edu/) and earn my PhD. [Prof. Michael Ortíz](http://www.ortiz.caltech.edu/) (who served as my academic adviser during the master, as thesis committee member and effectively as a co-adviser) has also been a strong influence during my formative years at Caltech.

The main theme of my thesis was applications of the path-independent integrals of Continuum Mechanics to Geotechnical Engineering. Along the way, I got acquainted with 1D Site Response Analysis, and I have thoroughly enjoyed working on the subject ever since. 
I have had a chance to stay at Caltech for an extra year to wrap up some side work on Seismic Metamaterials, while working on a project with the USGS to study the seismic response of rock pinnacles.
